# Rune Matching App
This is RuneScribbler, an app designed to test of your rune knowledge. <br>
In case of minimal prior knowledge to runes, you may treat it as an unforgiving memory puzzle - where the philosophy is learning by doing. <br><br>
You will be shown an image of an rune and asked to match it. <br> 
You may select to match with the modern day letter equivalent, or to match with the name of the rune.
