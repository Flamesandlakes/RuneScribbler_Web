<h1>Rune Matching App<h1>
This is RuneScribbler, an app designed to test of your rune knowledge. \n
In case of minimal prior knowledge to runes, you may treat it as an unforgiving memory puzzle - where the philosophy is learning by doing. \n
You will be shown an image of an rune and asked to match it. You may select to match with the modern day letter equivalent, or to match with the name of the rune.
